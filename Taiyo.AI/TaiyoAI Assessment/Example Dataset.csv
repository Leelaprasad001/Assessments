The Central Federal Lands Highway Division (CFL) of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), in cooperation with the Santa Cruz County Regional Transportation Commission (RTC), proposes the development of the North Coast Rail Trail Project. The project consists of 7.5 miles of multi-use trail parallel to existing railroad tracks north of the City of Santa Cruz, California. The Project would provide an accessible bicycle/pedestrian path for active transportation, recreation, and environmental and cultural education along the existing rail corridor between Wilder Ranch State Park and Davenport, CA, consistent with the Monterey Bay Sanctuary Scenic Trail (MBSST) Network Master Plan. The limits of the Project are Wilder Ranch Parking Lot on the South (rail mile post 23.6) and a private drive railroad crossing access (rail mile post 28.6) on the north side.

The Central Federal Lands Highway Division (CFLHD) of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), in cooperation with the US Forest Service, Inyo National Forest (INF), the Town of Mammoth Lakes (TOML), and the National Park Service, Devils Postpile National Monument (DEPO) are proposing improvements to Reds Meadow Road. Reds Meadow Road is 8.3 miles long and provides the only access to several Inyo National Forest campgrounds, day use parking areas, trailheads, horse camp and equestrian facilities, Minaret Vista entrance station, Devils Postpile National Monument, and Reds Meadow Resort and Pack Station. Reds Meadow is a popular area for outdoor recreation, including access for the John Muir and Pacific Crest Trails, and is important to the local tourism economy during the summer. The proposed project includes reconstruction and widening of the upper 2.5 miles to two lanes and rehabilitating the existing two-lane pavement width in the lower 5.8 miles.
Purpose
The purpose of the overall project is to improve the deteriorated condition of Reds Meadow Road and improve mobility, so as to continue to provide access to recreational resources. These improvements would facilitate emergency responses in the valley and the U.S. Forest Service goal of enhancing traffic safety by reducing the likelihood of a vehicular crash.
Need
The need to improve the deteriorated condition and mobility on Reds Meadow Road is driven by the presence of the following roadway conditions and design deficiencies that affect its operational condition:

Insufficient roadway widths
Structurally deficient pavement conditions
Sub-grade settlement and fill slope movement
Poor surface drainage and non-functioning ditches
Substandard sight distances, narrow shoulders, and road side hazards
